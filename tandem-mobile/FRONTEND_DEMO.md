## 🔄 Adding Real Backend Later

When you're ready to connect Firebase:

1. **Set up Firebase** (follow QUICKSTART.md)
2. **Replace mock hooks** with real Firebase calls
3. **Update stores** to use actual data
4. **Keep the UI exactly the same** - it's already built!

The architecture is designed so you can swap out:

```typescript
// Current (Mock)
import { useMockAuth } from '@shared/hooks/useMockAuth';
const { user } = useMockAuth();

// Future (Real Firebase)
import { useAuth } from '@features/auth/hooks/useAuth';
const { user } = useAuth();
```

All the UI stays the same - just the data source changes!

## 🚀 Next Steps
